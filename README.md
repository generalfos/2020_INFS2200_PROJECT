# 2020_INFS2200_PROJECT

Project in which I populated a database through an Oracle DBMS with appropriate data. Then designed and implemented the database according to a provided database schema as well as additional provided constraints through project tasks.

As a final exercise of this project, I was instructed to test the database through the construction of appropriate SQL queries and evaluate their output.
